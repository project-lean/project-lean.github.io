These stacks are specially helpful for startups and anyone developing a prototype/MVP that don't wan't to spend to release as fast as possible.</p>

<p>We are going to publish a series of guides about different technologies and by the end of each guide you will hopefully have fully functional prototype.</p>

<p>If you wan't to collaborate with a class about a technology stack, just open an issue with your suggested stack here: <a href="https://github.com/project-lean/project-lean.github.io/issues">https://github.com/project-lean/project-lean.github.io/issues</a>. If this stack isn't already covered we will create a repository for it on our organization, if the stack is already covered by a course you can always create pull requests to help us improve it</p>
