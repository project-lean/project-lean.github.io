After all, helping is what this project is all about. You can talk to us about any of the published courses at our Gitter channel: project-lean.gitter.im\r\n\r\n### How can I help?\r\nIf you wan't to collaborate with a class about a technology stack, just open an issue with your suggested stack here: https://github.com/project-lean/project-lean.github.io/issues. If this stack isn't already covered we will create a repository for it on our organization, if the stack is already covered by a course you can always create pull requests to help us improve it","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
